The hoedmd_stls.m is the code for the pth-order extended dynamic mode decomposition based on the structured total least squares proposed in the paper [1]. The first two subsections of our experiments were performed by this implementation.

The hoedmd_gram.m is the code for the efficient implementation of LB-DMD based on the Gram matrix (Algorithm 1 in our paper).

The data_generation.m is the code for generating the simulated dynamic manifold system of the first subsection of our experiment.

The apply_hoedmd_gram.m demonstrates the application of the LB-DMD method to experiment with the Robust network exploration in the task-fMRI data section in our paper. Other experiments are similar.
